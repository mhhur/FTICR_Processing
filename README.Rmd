Future package planning: 

Vignette proposed
- significance of abundence across treatments
- histogram: Abundence of type X (ie 'lipid') across samples

Function wish list
- NMNDNS (NMDS) and PCA (package, vegan/FactorMineR already does alot of this)
- KMD (Kendric mass defect) plot
  + Norminal kendrick mass  vs Kendric mass defect (mass/ [mass of CH2 or COO])
- C number vs HC/DBE/OC plot
- Cluster analysis of presence/absence for mass to charge ratio (m/z)
